  data,
  model_call_string,
  ...,
  boot_it = 100,
  seed = 0,
  boot_alpha = 0.05,
  boot_centre = "mean",

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe. Dataset that will be bootstrapped.}

\item{model_call_string}{character. Character string of the full call for the model,
except that the data option must be left out. The data option will be replaced with the \code{data} argument.}

\item{...}{not used. Inserted to require explicit naming of subsequent arguments.}

\item{boot_it}{integer from 0 to Inf. Number of bootstrap iterations.
If boot_it = 0, then the model is run as normal once on the full \code{data} with
no bootstrap.}

\item{seed}{integer. Random seed. Supply this between runs to assure identical
bootstrap samples are generated each time on the same data.}

\item{boot_alpha}{numeric. The confidence level for the bootstrap confidence intervals is
1 - boot_alpha. For example, the default 0.05 will give a 95\% confidence
interval, that is, from the 2.5\% to the 97.5\% percentile.}

\item{boot_centre}{See documentation for \code{ale}}

\item{output}{character vector. Which types of bootstraps to calculate and return:
\itemize{
\item 'ale': Calculate and return bootstrapped ALE data and plot.
\item 'model_stats': Calculate and return bootstrapped overall model statistics.
\item 'model_coefs': Calculate and return bootstrapped model coefficients.
\item 'boot_data': Return full data for all bootstrap iterations. This data will always be calculated
because it is needed for the bootstrap averages. By default, it is not returned
except if included in this \code{output} argument.
}}

\item{ale_options, tidy_options, glance_options}{list of named arguments.
Arguments to pass to the \code{ale}, \code{broom::tidy}, or \code{broom::glance} functions, respectively,
beyond (or overriding) the defaults.}

\item{silent}{See documentation for \code{ale}}
}
\value{
list with tibbles of the following elements (depending on values requested in
the \code{output} argument:
\itemize{
\item model_stats: bootstrapped results from \code{broom::glance}
\item model_coefs: bootstrapped results from \code{broom::tidy}
\item ale: bootstrapped ALE results
\itemize{
\item data: ALE data (see \code{ale} for details about the format)
\item stats: ALE statistics. The same data is duplicated with different views
that might be variously useful. The column
\itemize{
\item by_term: statistic, estimate, conf.low, median, mean, conf.high.
("term" means variable name.)
The column names are compatible with the \code{broom} package. The confidence intervals
are based on the \code{ale} function defaults; they can be changed with the
\code{ale_options} argument. The estimate is the median or the mean, depending
on the \code{boot_centre} argument.
\item by_statistic: term, estimate, conf.low, median, mean, conf.high.
\item estimate: term, then one column per statistic Provided with the default
estimate. This view does not present confidence intervals.
}
\item plots: ALE plots (see \code{ale} for details about the format)
}
\item boot_data: full bootstrap data (not returned by default)
\item other values: the \code{boot_it}, \code{seed}, \code{boot_alpha}, and \code{boot_centre} arguments that
were originally passed are returned for reference.

\description{
Execute full model bootstrapping with ALE calculation on each bootstrap run
}
\details{
No modelling results, with or without ALE, should be considered reliable without
being bootstrapped.
For large datasets with clear separation between training and testing samples,
\code{ale} bootstraps the ALE results of the test data. However, when a dataset
is too small to be subdivided into training and test sets, then the entire
model should be bootstrapped. That is, multiple models should be trained,
one on each bootstrap sample. The reliable results are the average results
of all the bootstrap models, however many there are. For details, see
the vignette on small datasets or the details and examples below.

\code{model_bootstrap} automatically carries out full-model bootstrapping suitable
for small datasets. Specifically, it:
\itemize{
\item Creates multiple bootstrap samples (default 100; the user can specify any number);
\item Creates a model on each bootstrap sample;
\item Calculates model overall statistics, variable coefficients, and ALE values
for each model on each bootstrap sample;
\item Calculates the mean, median, and lower and upper confidence intervals for
each of those values across all bootstrap samples.
}
